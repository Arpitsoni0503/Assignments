console.log("Hello World")

    // --------- Key points which i have learned in Assignment 1 ---------

/* 1. Press node -v in terminal to check the version of Node.js installed. if it is not showing then it is not installed yet.
   2. Executing JavaScript with Node: Two ways  (i). Node REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) (ii). Node.js script file
                  (i) Node.js REPL: It is an interactive shell that allows you to execute JavaScript code in real-time.
                      In terminal, type `node` and press Enter. You can then type JavaScript code directly into the terminal. 
                      in terminal then type our first Node.js program: console.log("Hello World!");
                      It will print "Hello World!" to the console. 

                  (ii) Simply type in terminal node filename.js to execute the JavaScript code in that file. it will print "Hello World!" to the console.
